How to run the experiment:
With the experiment there are two ways you might have to run it. 
But before you look at the specific instructions, make sure you set up the COM on TestBench:

In terms of setting up TestBench, make sure you select COM11 (for the soundbooth room) or COM13 (for the main lab room). The library that
is in use communicates from one port to another, so make sure you select the corresponding one.

I. Python 2.7 is the default, you only have to click on main.py in the folder food_decision_task_master. Then input the correct COM
in the text field (i.e. the soundbooth room needs COM9, the main room needs COM8)


II. Python 3.5 is the default, so it is more complex! Follow these instructions or it will crash:
1. Open the command line
2. Type: activate py27
This opens up the environment in py2.7, which is what the task uses
3. Move to the correct folder. So type cd c:/users/lab/desktop/food_task
4. Now type: python main.py
5. It should run!

Input the participant number, don't mess with the date, and put COM8 or COM9 depending on the computer.
