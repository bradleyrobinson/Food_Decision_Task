How to run the experiment:
With the experiment there are two ways you might have to run it. 
But before you look at the specific instructions, make sure you set up the COM on TestBench:

In terms of setting up TestBench, make sure you select COM11 (for the soundbooth room) or COM13 (for the main lab room). The library that
is in use communicates from one port to another, so make sure you select the corresponding one.

I. For the soundbooth room:
1. Python 2.7 is the default, you only have to click on main.py in the folder food_decision_task_master. 
2. Make sure you input the correct COM in the text field, which is COM9!!!


II. For the main lab room: 
Python 3.5 is the default, so it is more complex! Follow these instructions or it will crash:
1. Open the command line
2. Type: "activate py27"
This opens up the environment in py2.7, which is what the task uses
3. Move to the correct folder. So type cd c:/users/lab/desktop/food_task
4. Now type: "python main.py"
5. It should run.
6. Input the participant number, don't mess with the date, and put "COM8" for the serial port
